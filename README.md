## Description and Motivation
"Accessibility" is a word that gets thrown frequently, but a lot of developers seem to be unsure about what it translates into when it comes to practical application. On a similar note, accessibility doesn't always make it to the top of the priority list when applications are being built. That being said, accessibility is extremely important for a variety of reasons. Accessibility practices can have a huge impact on the way that folks with disabilities interact with software and failure to incorporate such practices can have hugely negative consequences.  

AccessiReference is being built in hopes of simplifying the process of implementing accessibility features. The main point is to make it easy to drag and drop accessibility features into applications in a simple and convenient way. Put simply, this application is designed to take the guesswork out of accessibility in hopes of making the web a more open, inclusive space.

## Build Status
This application is brand new and is currently in the earliest stages of the development process. Stay tuned for changes, updates, expansions, and more!
